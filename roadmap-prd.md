## Phase 3: Full CMS (Advanced Settings + Extensibility) ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Deliver a full-featured CMS with advanced system controls, appearance management, and staff roles.

- **Admin Dashboard (Super Admin Modules)**
  - Website Setup:
    - Header, Footer, Banners
    - Pages CRUD (SEO fields)
    - Appearance (theme colors, SEO, scripts, cookie message)
  - Settings:
    - Shop settings (logos, metadata, banners, featured products)
    - General settings (cache, maintenance mode, system info)
    - OTP settings (multiple gateways)
    - Languages (multi-language support)
    - Currency management
    - SMTP settings
    - Payment methods (ZainCash, FastPay Iraq, QiCard, etc.)
    - 3rd party (Google Analytics)
    - Backup & Restore
    - Shipping countries/governorates
  - Staff Management (Staff CRUD + Roles)
  - System:
    - Updates
    - Server Status
    - Addons Manager

- **Technical**
  - Full RTL/LTR support
  - Deployment (Vercel/Netlify ready + optional Docker setup)
  - Security hardening (clickjacking prevention, token leakage protection, audit system)

### Phase 3 Milestones (4â€“6 weeks)

- Milestone 1 (Week 1): Appearance & Pages
  - Pages CRUD: static pages with SEO fields (title, description, slug, meta)
  - Appearance settings: theme colors, logos, favicon, header/footer builder (config-driven)
  - Cookie banner + custom script injection (head/body)

- Milestone 2 (Week 2): Advanced Settings
  - General settings (cache toggle, maintenance mode, system info panel)
  - SMTP settings with test email endpoint
  - OTP providers panel (switch between gateways, set sender IDs)
  - Google Analytics (measurement ID) + basic events

- Milestone 3 (Week 3): Payments & Localization
  - Payment methods (ZainCash, FastPay Iraq, QiCard) with sandbox keys and enable/disable per provider
  - Currencies (default currency, formatting) and exchange rates
  - Languages (i18n scaffolding, locale switcher, translation keys for UI)

- Milestone 4 (Week 4): Staff Management & Roles
  - Staff CRUD (invite flow via email, password set)
  - Roles & permissions (SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN, EDITOR, SUPPORT, POS)
  - Route guards and component-level permission checks

- Milestone 5 (Week 5â€“6): System & Hardening
  - Backup/Restore (database export/import)
  - Updates panel (app version, changelog link)
  - Server status (health checks for DB, cache, queue, websockets)
  - Audit logs (who did what, when) for sensitive actions
  - Pen-test fixes and security headers review

### Deliverables
- New routes and UIs under `/admin/settings`, `/admin/appearance`, `/admin/system`, `/admin/staff`, `/admin/pages`
- Prisma schema updates for Staff, Roles, Pages, Settings (key-value or structured tables)
- REST APIs with RBAC checks and validation
- E2E happy-path validation for payments test-mode

### Acceptance Criteria
- Appearance changes (logo, colors) reflect across client and admin without redeploy
- Pages CRUD renders on the client (e.g., `/pages/:slug`) with SEO meta tags
- At least one payment method can be enabled and test-charged in sandbox
- Staff roles restrict access appropriately (e.g., SUPPORT cannot access Products CRUD)
- System health page shows green checks for DB and websockets in dev
- All settings persisted in DB and survive restarts

### Risks & Mitigations
- Payments integration delays â†’ implement provider-agnostic adapter; ship ZainCash first
- i18n scope creep â†’ start with UI strings + page slugs, defer product translations
- Backup/restore complexity â†’ begin with DB dump/restore endpoints, add UI later

### Tracking
- Create issues for each milestone and sub-feature; link to PRs
- Tag Phase 3 PRs with `phase:3`, `area:settings|payments|appearance|staff`
